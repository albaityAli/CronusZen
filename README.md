# CronusZen

This project goes to collectiveminds.com, checks if cronus zen is in stock, refreshes every 30 seconds until it is and then buys it.

To use this make sure you go to checkout.py and create profiles as instances of the class Profile since this script does not use an external csv file.
It does not use proxies or any captcha bypasser.

You must also insert your discord API key in main.py and the channel ID you want to use to have the bot send messages in.
